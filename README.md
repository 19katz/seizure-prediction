# seizure-prediction
This is the seizure prediction project that I implemented. I received a Synopsys Science Fair First Prize for it and qualified for the California State Science Fair. 

## Getting Started

### Installing

First, download the data files from https://www.kaggle.com/c/seizure-detection to the directory data/. 
### Running

Then, create the directory processed_data and run preprocess.py.

```
python preprocess.py
```

Afterwards, run run_trainer.py. 

```
run_trainer.py
```
