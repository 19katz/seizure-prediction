# seizure-prediction
This is the seizure prediction project that I implemented. I received a Synopsys Science Fair First Prize for it and qualified for the California State Science Fair. Part of the code is based on the following paper: Pouya Bashivan, Irina Rish, Mohammed Yeasin, and Noel Codella. Learning representations from eeg with deep recurrent convolutional neural networks. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations, 2016. To run the code, first download the data files from https://www.kaggle.com/c/seizure-detection to data/. Then, create the directory processed_data and run preprocess.py. Afterwards, run run_trainer.py.
